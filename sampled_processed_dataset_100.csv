Instructions:
To begin making the Gujarati Puran Poli Recipe, we will first make the dough. Add whole wheat flour into a large bowl; add salt and combine it with little water at a time and knead until the dough gathers together to form a firm dough yet soft dough. Add the 2 tablespoons of oil to coat the dough and knead for a couple of more minutes until smooth and firm. Cover and let the dough sit in a cool place until we get the puran filling ready. Divide the dough into 6 portions.Soak the dal for 15 to 20 minutes in water.Add the soaked dal with 1-1/4 cups of water (includes the soaked water) into the pressure cooker and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles and turn off the heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally. Once the pressure releases, give the dal a quick mash.The next step is the make the puran filling. Into a heavy bottomed pan, add the cooked dal, and jaggery.Keep stirring until the jaggery dissolves completely.Stir in the saffron, cardamom and nutmeg to the jaggery mixture until well combined to make the puran poli filling. Add the besan at this point and mix it into the dal mixture and ensure it blends well without any lumps.Continue stirring the puran poli mixture until the dal mixture begins to thicken and leaves the sides of the pan.At this point turn off the heat and allow the puran poli mixture to cool completely. Divide the dough and puran mixture into 6 portions.Keeping a little flour for dusting handy on a plate; roll out the puran poli dough into 3 inch diameter circles.Place a portion of the puran poli mixture into the center of the circle.Bring edges of the circle towards the center and fold over to cover the entire filling; making sure the edges are all sealed well by pinching them together if there is any opening.Flatten the stuffed dough; dust over a little flour and roll gently into a 4 to 6 inch diameter circle taking care not to put too much pressure as the puran can come out of the dough.Preheat a skillet on medium high; place the rolled puran poli onto the skillet to cook until golden brown on both sides. At this point you can cook it along with ghee to make the puran poli crisp and delicious. Or you can make a dry puran poli and serve it along with ghee.Repeat the above process for all the remaining dough and puran portions.Serve the Gujarati Puran Poli hot with ghee smeared on the top as it is or along with Undhiyu and Gujarati Kadhi to make a delicious meal.

- Oil: for serving
Instructions:
To begin making the Phulka (roti/ chapati) recipe, first bring all the ingredients together and we will make the dough.In a large bowl combine the flour and salt; add a little water at a time to make firm dough. Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.Set the dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat. Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.Take a portion of the phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the rolled dough as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.Tip: It is a good idea to roll out a batch of dough so it gets easier to cook the entire batch. Although Gujarati ladies are very quick in rolling and cooking them simultaneously; this comes with practice of rolling and understanding the heat of your skillet.

Add pureed tomatoes into the pan along with the rest of the ingredients - dried thyme leaves, tabasco sauce, sugar, red chilli flakes and salt.Mix well, cover it with the lid and cook it over a low heat for about 15 minutes. Keep it aside to cool down.To make the topping, heat a flat skillet with oil, add chicken pieces and fry for few seconds, add barbecue sauce and saute well for 2 more minutes and switch it off.When the dough has risen and the topping is ready, make the pizza when you are ready to serve it - else the pizza will get brittle and the paneer will become stiff.Preheat a skillet or an iron tawa on medium heat. Divide the pizza dough into 4 portions.Dust the pizza dough on flour and roll to make a 5 inch circle or the thickness you like for the pizza crust.Place the rolled dough on the tawa and cook it like a roti on both sides.Spread a little oil on the top of the dough and flip to make it face the bottom.Next spread the tomato sauce evenly, drizzle the mozzarella cheese. Add the Barbecue chicken topping on the pizza and spread it evenly.Cover the pan and allow the cheese to melt and also wait for the crust to get a slightly crisp from the sides. This will take about 4 to 5 minutes.You can bake it in the oven also for about 10 minutes till the crust turns golden brown.Once done, remove the Barbecue Chicken Pizza from the oven and serve.Proceed the same way with the remaining pizza dough and serve immediately.Serve the Chicken Barbecue Pizza along with Spaghetti Pasta Alla Puttanesca and a glass of Mango Ginger Virgin Mojito for your weekend dinner.
