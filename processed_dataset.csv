To begin making the Moong Dal Halwa Recipe, soak the moong dal in water for at least 3 hours.Once soaked, drain the water completely and grind the moong dal into a coarse mixture using the food processor. You need to ensure that it does not become a paste, but has a coarse texture.Heat ghee in a heavy bottomed pan on medium heat; add the ground moong dal and reduce to the heat to low stirring the mixture continuously, allowing it to turn golden brown from its yellowish texture. The above process of cooking the lentil in low heat is very crucial to a delicious tasting halwa. It takes a good 45 minutes for it to cook in the low heat and get to a beautiful golden brown state. Take care not to turn the heat to high to speed up the process.The low heat cooking helps the moong dal to cook well and turn brown evenly releasing the perfect rustic aroma.Once the moong dal is well cooked and reached a golden brown state; add the sugar, milk, saffron and mix well until combined.Continue to stir on low heat until the mixture thickens releases itself from the sides of the pan; this process would take another 20 to 30 minutes.
